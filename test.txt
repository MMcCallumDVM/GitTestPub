To Whom It May Concern,

Success in the sales world requires perseverance, a persuasive communication approach, and outstanding interpersonal and negotiation skills. As a driven sales professional with 15+ years of experience managing customer relationships and accounts to drive revenue and market share growth, I stand in a prime position to significantly contribute to your objectives as your Sales Executive.

I possess excellent organizational, customer service and interpersonal skills with a keen eye for detail.
In addition to the above, I can comfortably work autonomously or as part of a team, multi-tasking, prioritizing and coordinating several activities at once. I have the ability, willingness to quickly increase my product knowledge to what it required.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
